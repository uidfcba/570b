    "##  Introduction to Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson explores feature selection, which is a technique for improving the performance of machine learning algorithms by focusing on those features that contain the most predictive power. A side-note to this main point is that feature selection also has important ethical considerations when building models that are designed to avoid discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- explain the benefits of feature selection,\n",
    "- articulate the impact of feature selection on model application,\n",
    "- explain the differences between feature selection techniques such as select k best, select percentiles, and recursive feature extraction,\n",
    "- apply feature selection by using the scikit learn library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 2 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activities \n",
    "\n",
    "Video: Watch the [introduction to feature selection][fsv] video, which will demonstrate simple techniques for feature selection including techniques for algorithmically  determining the _best_ features and quantifying the importance of specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook: Read and complete the practice exercises in the [Introduction to feature selection][intro2fs] notebook.\n",
