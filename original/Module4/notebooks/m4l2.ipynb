    "##  Introduction to Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson explores how to identify conditions for overfitting and the general challenge implicit in the bias-variance tradeoff. In addition, cross-validation, which is a technique used to reduce the likelihood of overfitting, is introduced as are learning and validation curves, which can aid in selecting the best model and training sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- articulate the bias-variance tradeoff and how it impacts model selection,\n",
    "- explain how cross-validation can reduce the likelihood of overfitting,\n",
    "- apply cross-validation by using the scikit learn library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 2 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activities \n",
    "\n",
    "Reading: Read about why your [modeling results][rmr] aren't as good as you think due to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading: Read about the [bias-variance tradeoff][bvt] in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Video: Watch the [Introduction to Cross-Validation][iov] video, which will demonstrate the concepts behind overfitting and ways to overcome it, including cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook: Read and complete the practice exercises in the [Introduction to Cross-Validation][intro2of] notebook.\n",
