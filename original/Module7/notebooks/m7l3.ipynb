    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces an alternative clustering technique, DB-SCAN, that finds clusters based on the spatial density of points. One of the main benefits of DB-SCAN is that the number of clusters does not need to be specified a prior.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to \n",
    "\n",
    "- articulate the basic concepts behind density clustering algorithms,\n",
    "- explain how the DBSCAN algorithm works to identify clusters, and\n",
    "- apply the DBSCAN algorithm by using the scikit learn library to perform cluster analysis.\n",
