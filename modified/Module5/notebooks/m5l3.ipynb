    "##  Introduction to Gaussian Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces Gaussian Processes, in which a set of Gaussian (or Normal) distributions are used to infer the underlying functional relationship among a set of data. \n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- articulate the basic concepts underlying a Gaussian Process,\n",
    "- explain the probabilistic underpinning behind a Gaussian Process, and\n",
    "- apply Gaussian Process by using the scikit learn library.\n",

    "Reading: Learn about the [Gaussian Process algorithm][cfgp] and its application by using the scikit learn module in the  blog article _Fitting Gaussian Process Models in Python_ by Chris Fonnesbeck on the Domino Data lab website. You can skip the Introductory _Building models with Gaussians_ section, which is optional. Do not read the GPflow or PyMC3 sections, which describe other Python modules.\n",

    "Reading: Interact with the [Gaussian process regression][vgp] website by Pradeep Ranganathan to learn how the addition of new data points constrict a Gaussian process.\n",

    "Video: Watch the [Introduction to Gaussian Processes][igpv] video, which will introduce Gaussian Processes and demonstrate how they can be used for machine learning.\n",
