    "With the growth of machine learning, there is an ever growing list of algorithms that can be used to model data. In previous notebooks, we have introduced many of the most popular machine learning algorithms, including linear and logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and ensemble techniques like random forest and gradient boosted decision trees. In addition, these algorithms all have their own set of hyperparameters whose values, for optimal performance, must be carefully selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, selecting the best model and associated set of hyperparameters can be a daunting task. In this notebook, we explore the topic of [**Model Selection**][skms] by first manually evaluating one hyperparameter for one machine learning algorithm on a specific data set. This will introduce the basic concepts required to perform model selection, before we move into more automated techniques. Following this, we will look at grid searches to find the best combinations of multiple hyperparameters. Finally, we will look at additional model selection techniques such as random hyperparameter searches and nested hyperparameter searches. \n",

    "\n",
    "Formally, model selection is the task of choosing the best machine learning model for a given data set. Thus, to get started, we first need a data set to which we can apply machine learning algorithms. For this purpose we will use the handwritten digit data set that is included with the scikit learn library. This data is comprised of 1,797 eight by eight pixel images, which results in 64 features (or dimensions). The first Code cell below load these data into our feature (`x`) and label (`y`) arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of simplicity, we will use only one machine learning algorithm in this notebook, and focus on finding the best hyperparameters for this one algorithm on these data. The machine learning algorithm we will use to classify these images in this notebook is support vector classification. We also need a scoring method, for support vector classification the default is mean accuracy (i.e., averaged across all classes). However, different (or multiple) [scoring methods][sksm] can be used, adding a further level of complexity to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm works best when the data are normalized (or at least scaled to the same ranges). While the individual pixel values are all restricted to the range [0, 16], some pixels are used more than others. For example, the pixels around the outer edges are used less frequently, and thus will likely be distributed differently than the center pixels. As a result, we employ a [`StandardScaling`][skss] estimator as part of a pipeline on these data to normalize all data before applying the SVC estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple example, we will only evaluate one potential hyperparameter (`C`) for this one algorithm. On a real-world problem, however, we likely would evaluate multiple algorithms, each with various hyperparameter combinations in order to determine the best model. We generate an array of eight `C` values for the model selection process spanning 0.001 to 1000. We generate these values in log-space, as this allows us to quickly span a large range of values. Once we have a better idea of the rough range containing the optimal hyperparameter, we can sample the hyperparameter on a finer grid to identify the best hyperparameter value for these data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms have parameters that can be adjusted to tune the performance of the algorithm on a particular data set, for example, the `C` parameter in SVM. While in some cases there is a theoretical justification for a particular parameter value when applied to a specific data set, in many cases, we must determine the parameter (sometimes called hyper-parameter) values programmatically. With multiple parameters, however, this process can quickly become tedious, e.g., when running DBSCAN and changing the `eps` and `min_samples` parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than repeatedly manually changing parameter values and computing the resulting model scores, a better approach is to employ a grid search approach. In a grid search, one defines a grid of parameter values, applies the model over all possible parameter value combinations in the grid, and identifies the set of parameters that produces the best model performance score. The scikit learn library provides a [`GridSearchCV`][skgs] object that performs a grid search by using cross validation, which produces a model score at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following Code cell, we demonstrate using `GridSearchCV` to compute the best value for the `C` parameter when running the SVC algorithm on the Handwritten Digit data. In this simple case, we simply employ the estimator directly, however, a grid search is often most effective when analyzing a pipeline that can have many free parameters.\n",

This provides additional functionality, including improved display of the results, as well as transformations provided by the Pandas module. In the following Code cell, we convert the `cv_results_` to a DataFrame, and display the _transpose_ (this just flips the columns to rows and vice versa), which makes the results easier to explore. In this view, the columns are now different cross-validation folds; we had seven different values for `C` in the grid search so there are seven columns.

    "The previous example performed a grid search on one hyperparameter. This approach can be extended to multiple hyperparameters by constructing a dictionary that maps the hyperparameters to the hyperparameter values. In the following Code cell, we demonstrate this by first creating arrays of our hyperparameter values, for both the `C` and `gamma` values. Next, we construct the grid of `C` and `gamma` values for the SVC algorithm by using an explicit dictionary. This grid has 48 (6 x 8) values, over which we perform stratified k-fold cross-validation using our SVC pipeline. At the end of the Code cell, we compute and display the processing time, the best fit hyperparameters, and the best cross-validation score.\n",

    "Another benefit of creating a DataFrame from the cross-validation results is that we can employ the Pandas DataFrame support to create insight into the process. For example, the next two Code cells first create a pivot table on the hyperparameters where the value is the mean test score. This pivot table is converted into a heat map in the second Code cell, which demonstrates the joint impact of these hyperparameters on the score from the validation data. In this case, we see the previous relatively constant scoring once the `C` value exceeds zero is actually dependent on the value of `gamma`. Thus, this demonstrates how the joint score distribution from all hyperparameters is needed to find the best model.\n",

A better approach is a programmatic interface that automatically constructs a grid of all possible combinations that can be used in a grid search.

This iterator enables the grid search to iterate through all possible hyperparameter combinations in a simple manner. \n",

    "## Randomized Grid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "For a large number of hyperparameters, the number of possible combinations quickly becomes excessive. Since we must evaluate the model for each possible combination of parameters, model selection with standard grid selection can become computationally intractable. An alternative approach is to randomly select possible hyperparameter combinations from the supplied grid of values to identify good parameter combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following Code cell, we demonstrate a random grid search by using the [`RandomizedSearchCV`][skrgs] estimator. First, we pass in our support vector machine pipeline, along with the parameter grid, and the number of parameter values to sample. As this last value increases, more parameter value combinations are sampled. These values are sampled randomly from a distribution for each parameter. If a list of values is provided (as we have done with previous grid searches), the values are randomly sampled from the list. Alternatively, a random distribution can be used. The requirement for these distributions is that they must contain an `rvs` method, which is provided by the random distributions in the `scipy.stats` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate both of these techniques in the example below, which computes scores for twenty different parameter combinations. In the second Code cell, we extract the best estimator and display the optimal parameters and associated score. Note that, while not the guaranteed best score (and hyperparameter values), the value is close. Thus, the random search cross-validation can be useful to get reasonable hyperparameters values much faster than with traditional techniques.\n",

    "## Nested Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the size of the available training data, we can also nest cross-validation techniques to enable all data to be used for training, validating, and testing. This can prove useful when the data are not excessively large and they span a wide space. If all data is not used to construct the model, we risk the model failing to recognize a particular aspect of the data. For example, if there are ten instances in our data set and only one contains information about an event, the only way our model _knows_ about the event is if that data is part of the training process. Of course, this means our final model predictions are not as robust as they would be if the model predicted on entirely unseen data, but it can be a worthwhile compromise in these special situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following Code cell we demonstrate nested cross-validation. First, we apply a stratified k-fold cross-validation to create testing and training data from our full digit data. Inside the loop we create a grid search cross-validation estimator that also uses stratified k-fold cross-validation. We train this grid search estimator on our original training data. But in this case, however, the original training data is split into a training and validation data set. We display the score and selected parameter values from the best estimator for each outer cross-validation fold. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the computational time for each fold is over one minute, which demonstrates the large computational ties that can result when using large grid searches to determine optimal model hyperparameters. In the end, multiple folds recommend the same set of hyperparameters. For a production system, we likely would want to explore the hyperparameter space at a finer resolution (perhaps first running a coarse grid to define the general space beforehand).\n",
