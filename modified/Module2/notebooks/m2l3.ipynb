    "## Introduction to Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces Decision Trees, which are a powerful algorithm for both classification and regression. Decision trees are simple to build and visualize, and thus can be useful in explaining why a classification or regression model makes specific predictions.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- articulate the basic concepts behind the decision tree algorithm,\n",
    "- create and use a decision tree by using the scikit learn library, and\n",
    "- apply this algorithm successfully to specific problem categories.\n",
