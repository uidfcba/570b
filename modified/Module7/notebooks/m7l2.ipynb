    "## Introduction to Spatial Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces one of the most popular clustering algorithms, K-means. Given a value _K_, this algorithm finds the best _K_ cluster centers and assigns points to these cluster centers based on their distances.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- articulate the basic concepts behind spatial clustering algorithms,\n",
    "- explain how the k-Means algorithm works to identify clusters, and\n",
    "- apply the k-Means algorithm by using the scikit learn library to perform cluster analysis.\n",
