    "# Module 6: Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "This module introduces an important concept in machine learning, the selection of the actual features that will be used by a machine learning algorithm. Along with data cleaning, this step in the data analytics process is extremely important, yet it is often overlooked as a method for improving the overall performance of an analysis. This module beings with a discussion of ethics in machine learning, in large part because the selection of features can have (sometimes) non-obvious impacts on the final performance of an algorithm. This can be important when machine learning is applied to data in a regulated industry or when the improper application of an algorithm might lead to discrimination. The rest of this module introduces different techniques for either selecting the best features in a data set, or the construction of new features from the existing set of features.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By the end of this module, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- articulate how machine learning might make _ethical_ mistakes,\n",
    "- indicate how machine learning models can be constructed to avoid making ethical mistakes,\n",
    "- understand the importance of including _ethics_ in artificial intelligence that will increasingly affect our everyday lives,\n",
    "- perform feature selection in data analytics scripts written in Python that use the scikit learn module,\n",
    "- perform dimensional reduction by using the scikit learn module, and\n",
    "- apply manifold learning to reduce the number of features in a large data set.\n",
