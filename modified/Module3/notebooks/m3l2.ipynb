    "## Introduction to Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces ensemble learning, and in particular the concept of bagging and the random forest, which implements bagging via many decisions trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- explain the concept of bagging,\n",
    "- articulate how bagging can improve the predictive power of a machine learning algorithm, and\n",
    "- apply bagging algorithms, such as the random forest, by using the scikit learn library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 2 hours.\n",
