    "## Production Data Analytics\t\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson focus on real world issues in data analytics, including techniques for achieving modeling success, the issues in data cleaning and preparation, and an overview of one of the more popular data analytic methodologies, CRISP-DM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand the challenges of building successful models in the real-world,\n",
    "- understand the differences between classroom analytics problems and those in the real-world, and\n",
    "- be able to articulate issues in promoting data analytic processes into production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 1 hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activities\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A major challenge academic face in teaching data analytics is the lack of real-world data sets, which teach the full spectrum of data analytics (which is much more than running a cool algorithm with scikit learn). The readings in this lesson address this issue by discussing  processes that produce success in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading: Read about achieving [modeling success][rms] from John Lucker of Deloitte in Wired magazine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reading: Read about how academics fail to teach students about the murky issues in [real world data analytics][ruf] by Maciej Wasiak on LinkedIn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading: Read about moving machine learning from [practice to production][rptp] by Ramanan Balakrishnan at Engineering@Semantics3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading: Read about how to build a [data science pipeline][rdsp] by Balazs Kegl on medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional** Reading: Read about the [CRISP-DM methodology][rcdm] , which stands for cross-industry process for data mining, from the Smart Vision Europe website.\n",
