    "## Introduction to Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson builds on the ordinary linear regression concept, introduced in the first eight week course, to discuss linear regression as a machine learning task. Regression, or the creation of a predictive model from data, is one of the key machine learning tasks. By using linear regression, which can often be solved analytically, we will introduce the concept of minimizing a cost function to determine the optimal model parameters in a straight-forward manner.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "- explain the role of the loss function in machine learning,\n",
    "- articulate how to compute a regression on multiple variables,\n",
    "- explain the different statistical measures that quantify the quality of a regression, \n",
    "- utilize categorical variables in a machine learning model, and\n",
    "- compute a linear regression mode by using the scikit_learn and statsmodel libraries.\n",
